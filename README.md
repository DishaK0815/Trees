## Understanding Trees in Data Structures

A Tree is a special type of data structure that—much like a linked list—is made up of nodes. But unlike linked lists, where each node points to only one next node, a tree node can connect to multiple nodes. 🌿➡️🌿➡️🌿




### 🌟 Why Trees Are So Useful?
Trees are incredibly powerful and appear almost everywhere in computer science! Here’s where they shine:

📁 Hierarchical Data
Used to represent folder structures, organizational charts, and any "parent‑child" style data.

⚡ Databases
Many database indexing systems (like B‑trees and AVL trees) use trees for super‑fast data lookup.

🌐 Routing Algorithms
Routing tables in networking often rely on tree-like structures to find efficient paths.

🔍 Searching & Sorting
Trees help perform searching and sorting operations efficiently—Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are classic examples.

⏫ Priority Queues
Often implemented using tree structures such as binary heaps, making operations like insertion and extraction very efficient. 🚀
